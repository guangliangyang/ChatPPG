prompt: ['<|start_prompt|>Dataset description: The Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT) is a crucial indicator in the electric power long-term deployment. This dataset consists of 2 years data from two separated counties in China. To explore the granularity on the Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) problem, different subsets are created, {ETTh1, ETTh2} for 1-hour-level and ETTm1 for 15-minutes-level. Each data point consists of the target value ”oil temperature” and 6 power load features. The train/val/test is 12/4/4 months.\n\nTask description: forecast the next 96 steps given the previous 512 steps information; Input statistics: min value -2.842104434967041, max value 2.49015736579895, median value -0.05286477133631706, the trend of input is downward, top 5 lags are : [0, 1, 511, 2, 510]<|<end_prompt>|>', '<|start_prompt|>Dataset description: The Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT) is a crucial indicator in the electric power long-term deployment.
