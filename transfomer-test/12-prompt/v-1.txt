This dataset captures key attributes influencing the trajectory and landing position of a table tennis ball, integrating temporal dynamics, spin classification, stroke type, scoring probability, and spatial positioning. The model's objective is to predict the next ball landing coordinates based on structured input embeddings. The guiding prompt embedding encodes domain-specific knowledge, providing a stable foundation for model learning. Each feature is paired with a corresponding data patch and a dedicated sub-prompt that encapsulates its dominant Fourier frequency, capturing periodic trends in ball movement. These structured embeddings, sequentially processed after the guiding prompt, enable the model to discern feature interdependencies and spatiotemporal patterns. The LLM processes these embeddings through a hierarchical learning framework, refining its understanding of shot mechanics, strategy execution, and game flow. The output embeddings are projected onto a spatial coordinate system to generate precise predictions of the next ball landing position, enhancing interpretability and predictive accuracy in competitive table tennis scenarios.
